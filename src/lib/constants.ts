export const ABOUT_US = `
I'm **Muhammad Fariz Rahman** — a Senior Frontend Engineer based in Indonesia.

I’m passionate about crafting accessible, fast, and visually refined interfaces that balance clean design with solid engineering. Over the past **7+ years**, I’ve focused on building seamless experiences across web and mobile using **React**, **Next.js**, and **Ionic**, while occasionally exploring **React Native** and **Nuxt**.

Though my main expertise lies in frontend, I’ve also worked with **Express**, **Fastify**, and **NestJS** on personal projects, along with databases like **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB** — giving me a broader understanding of full-stack workflows and system design.

My approach to development combines **attention to detail**, **performance**, and **usability**, ensuring that every product I work on feels intuitive, reliable, and built to last.

When I’m not coding, I usually spend my time learning new web technologies, refining side projects, or catching up with games and chill playlists.
