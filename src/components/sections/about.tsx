            I'm a developer passionate about creating accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that
            combine thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the
            intersection of design and development, creating experiences that not only look great
            but are also meticulously built for performance and usability.

            Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer specializing in accessibility. I contribute
            to building and maintaining UI components that power our frontend, ensuring our platform
            meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an inclusive user
            experience.

            In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software in various settings â€” from
            advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small digital product
            studios. Additionally, I released a comprehensive video course a few years ago, guiding
            learners through building a web app with the Spotify API.

            In my free time, I'm usually climbing, reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats,
            or running around Hyrule looking for Korok seeds.
